    description: "<a href='http://www.sixfriedrice.com'>Six Fried Rice</a> is a very small custom software firm, and I am the lead Ruby on Rails developer. I work on a wide variety of different projects at once. I have close to 100% responsibility on about half of the projects and work with 1-2 other people on the rest. Our focus on custom software for small and medium businesses means that my responsibilities are far greater than just writing code. I regularly design (both graphically and architecturally) both front- and back-end systems, provide experience recommendations, integrate with 3rd party APIs, and also administer web and database servers."
